# Intro
This project is about adding electronics to a vintage mechanical stenograph so it can be used with a computer running the [Plover](https://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/) software.




# Current status

I have wired up the typebars to a set of IO expanders and am able to send the corresponding keystroke to Plover via the Gemini protocol. I'm in the process of adding displays now as well as prototyping a typebar detection method that can sit under the typebars out of view.
